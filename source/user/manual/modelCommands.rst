Model Commands
--------------

These are the commands added to the interpreter to create the finite element model. A finite element model consists of **Nodes**, **Elements**, **Constraints**, and **Loads**. In OpenSees the Constraints are divided into two types: single-point constraints (**SP_Constraints)** for specifying the boundary condition for a specific degree-of-freedom at a node and multiple-point constraints (**MP_Constraints**) for specifying the relationship between the responses between the degrees-of-freedom at two separate nodes. The loads in OpenSees are assigned to **LoadPatterns**. Also associated with load patterns are **TimeSeries** objects ans sometime **SP_Constraints** when the user wants to specify time-varying **SP_Constraints**.

In OpenSees there are commands to add each of these types of objects to a domain:
