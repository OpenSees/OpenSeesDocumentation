.. function:: eleResponse $eleTag $arg1 $arg2 ....

.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Argument", "Type", "Description"
   :widths: 10, 10, 40

   $eleTag, |integer|, integer tag identifying element
   $args,  |list|, list of the arguments

.. note::
   
   #. The values obtained are for the current state of the element. 
   #. The arguments are specific to the type of element being used and are the same as those that are used in :ref:`elementRecorder`.

   Then following code can be used to obtain the current state related to the **forces** and the **material stress** in element **1**, a Truss element.

   1. **Tcl Code**

   .. code-block:: none

      set eleForces [eleResponse 1 forces]
      set eleMatStress [eleResponse 1 material stress]

   1. **Python Code**

   .. code-block:: python

      eleForces = eleResponse(1,'forces')
      eleMatStress = eleResponse(1, 'material','stress')
