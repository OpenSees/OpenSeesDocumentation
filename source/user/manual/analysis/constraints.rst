constraints Command
*******************

This command is used to construct the ConstraintHandler object. The ConstraintHandler object determines how the constraint equations are enforced in the analysis. Constraint equations define a specified value for a DOF, or a relationship between DOFs.

	$constraintType, |string|,  the constraints type
	$args, |list|,   a list of arguments for that type


The following contain information about numbererType? and the args required for each of the available dof numberer types:

The type of ConstraintHandler created and the additional arguments required depends on the constraintType? provided in the command.
