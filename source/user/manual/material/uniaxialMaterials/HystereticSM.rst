.. _HystereticSM:

HystereticSM Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command is used to construct a uniaxial multilinear hysteretic material object with pinching of force and deformation, damage due to ductility and energy, and degraded unloading stiffness based on ductility. This material is an extension of the Hysteretic Material -- the envelope can be defined 2,3, 5, or 7 points, while the original one only had 2 or 3.
This material also has additional DCR-type recorder output.

to be compatible with Hysteretic material:

.. function:: uniaxialMaterial Hysteretic $matTag $s1p $e1p $s2p $e2p <$s3p $e3p> <$s4p $e4p> <$s5p $e5p> <$s6p $e6p> <$s7p $e7p> $s1n $e1n $s2n $e2n <$s3n $e3n> <$s4n $e4n> <$s5n $e5n> <$s6n $e6n> <$s7n $e7n> $pinchX $pinchY $damage1 $damage2 <$beta> <-defoLimitStates lsD1? <lsD2?>...> <-forceLimitStates lsF1? <lsF2?>...>

NOTE: If you would like to enter strain-stress pairs us -posEnvXY instead of -posEnv

NOTE: For symmetric response, do not enter -negEnv data
