Linear Transformation
*********************

This command is used to construct a linear coordinate transformation (LinearCrdTransf) object, which performs a linear geometric transformation of beam stiffness and resisting force from the basic system to the global-coordinate system.

* For a two-dimensional problem:
.. function:: geomTransf Linear $transfTag <-jntOffset $dXi $dYi $dXj $dYj> 

* For a three-dimensional problem:
.. function:: geomTransf Linear $transfTag $vecxzX $vecxzY $vecxzZ <-jntOffset $dXi $dYi $dZi $dXj $dYj $dZj>

A refresher on Euclidean Geometry and Coordinate Systems:

A single vector may be defined by two points. It has length, direction, and location in space. When this vector is used to define a coordinate axis, only its direction is important. Now any 2 vectors, :math:`V_r` and :math:`V_s`, not parallel, define a plane that is parallel to them both. The cross-product of these vectors define a third vector, :math:`V_t`, that is perpendicular to both :math:`V_r` and :math:`V_s` and hence normal to the plane: :math:`V_t = V_r . V_s`.


The element coordinate system is specified as follows:

The x-axis is a vector given by the two element nodes; The vector **vecxz** is a vector the user specifies that must not be parallel to the x-axis. The x-axis along with the **vecxz** Vector define the xz plane. The local y-axis is defined by taking the cross product of the x-axis vector and the **vecxz** vector (:math:`V_y = V_{xz} . V_x`). The local z-axis is then found simply by taking the cross product of the y-axis and x-axis vectors (:math:`V_z = V_x . V_y`). The section is attached to the element such that the y-z coordinate system used to specify the section corresponds to the y-z axes of the element.

.. note::
	When in 2D, local x and y axes are in the X-Y plane, where X and Y are global axes. Local x axis is the axis connecting the two element nodes, and local y and z axes follow the right-hand rule (e.g., if the element is aligned with the positive Y axis, the local y axis is aligned with the negative X axis, and if the element is aligned with the positive X axis, the local y axis is aligned with the positive Y axis). Orientation of local y and z axes is important for definition of the fiber section.

   1. **Tcl Code**

   .. code-block:: tcl

	#Element 1 : tag 1 : vecxZ = zaxis
	geomTransf Linear 1 0 0 -1

	#Element 2 : tag 2 : vecxZ = y axis
	geomTransf Linear 2 0 1 0

	#If there was a rigid offset at the top of element 1:
	geomTransf Linear 1 0 0 -1 -jntOffset 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 -$Offset 0.0

   2. **Python Code**

   .. code-block:: python
   
	#Element 1 : tag 1 : vecxZ = zaxis
	geomTransf('Linear', 1, 0, 0, -1)

	#Element 2 : tag 2 : vecxZ = y axis
	geomTransf('Linear', 2, 0, 1, 0)

	#If there was a rigid offset at the top of element 1: (offset is a variable that the offset value has been stored in)
	geomTransf('Linear', 3, 0, 0, -1,'-jntOffset',0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, offset, 0.0)
