| This command is used to construct an ASDAbsorbingBoundary2D or ASDAbsorbingBoundary3D  object.
| The ASDAbsorbingBoundary2D is a 4-node quadrilateral element, while the ASDAbsorbingBoundary3D is a 8-node hexaedron element.
| This elements can be used as an extra layer at the boundaries of a soil domain to avoid wave reflections which typically arise with fixed boundaries.

Theory
""""""

| When modelling a soil, only a portion of it is modelled, using artificial boundaries around it.
  Fixed conditions at these artificial boundaries are fine in static problems, but in dynamic problems they will reflect outgoing propagating waves.
  This problem can be avoided using a large portion of the model, which is impractical due to excessive computational efforts.
  Another solution is to adopt special boundary conditions which are able to absorb outgoing waves.
| This element has been implemented following the work described in [Nielsen2006]_ for the 2D case, and properly extended for the 3D case.
  For a detailed theory explanation, please refer to [Nielsen2006]_ and the references therein.
| In summary, this element can be seen as an assembly of many components:

    * **F**: The Free-Field element, required to compute the free-field solution in parallel with the main model.
    * **D**: The Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer dashpots, required to absorb outgoing waves.
    * **T**: The boundary tractions transferred from the Free-Field to the Soil domain, required to impose the free-field solution to the boundaries of the main model.

Usage Notes
"""""""""""

.. admonition:: Note 1

   The element should have the standard node-numbering to ensure a proper positive jacobian.

      Node numbering.

.. admonition:: Note 2

   The behavior of the element changes based on the side of the model it belongs to. The $btype argument defines the boundary type of the element.
   It is a string made of a combination of characters. Each character describes a side of the model:
      
      * **B** = Bottom
      * **L** = Left
      * **R** = Right
      * **F** = Front (only for 3D problems)
      * **K** = Back (only for 3D problems)
   
   | For a 2D problem you can have the following valid combinations: **B**, **L**, **R**, **BL**, **BR**
   | For a 3D problem you can have the following valid combinations: **B**, **L**, **R**, **F**, **K**, **BL**, **BR**, **BF**, **BK**, **LF**, **LK**, **RF**, **RK**, **BLF**, **BLK**, **BRF**, **BRK**

.. admonition:: Note 3
   
   | The element works in two stages.
   | In **Stage 0**, the element acts as a fix condition, suitable for the first gravity analysis. It stores the reactions and automatically converts them into applied boundary forces when switching from **Stage 0** to **Stage 1**.
   | In **Stage 1**, the is converted into the real absorbing elements, and the reactions of the previous constraint element are applied as external forces.
   | The conversion from **Stage 0** to **Stage 1** can be done with the **setParameter** command (See Example)

.. warning::

   * The boundary elements should be an extrusion of the sides of the main model along their outward normal vector.
   * The vertical sides of the main model should have an outward normal vector that points either along the global (positive or negative) X direction or along the global (positive or negative) Y vector.
   * The bottom side of the main model should have an outward normal vector that points in the negative global Z direction.
   * In 3D models the sides L (left),R (right),F (front) and K (back) may have some natural distortion due to the topography. This is supported by the boundary element, but when the distortion along the Z direction is too large, the results can slightly deteriorate.

.. admonition:: Example 

   1. **Tcl Code**

   | This is a small 2D example of a rectangular soil domain. The base input is a Ricker Wavelet.
   | With these boundary elements you should be able to **1) enforce the free-field solution** on the soil domain and **2) absorb outgoing waves** generated when the primary wave hits the free-surface.
   | This is the expected output: The blue line is the acceleration recorded at the base of the model. Point **A** and **B** represent respectively the wave entering the domain and the same wave exiting the domain after being reflected
     by the free surface. Their peak value should be exactly 1g. The purple line is the acceleration recorded at the top of the model (on the free surface). Point **C** represents the wave hitting the free-surface. Its peak value should be exactly 2g.
