Python Install
==============

There are two packages that can be used to install OpenSees from Python:

1. `openseespy <https://pypi.org/project/openseespy>`_ is a Python package developed by Dr. Zhu and Prof. Scott at Oregon State University which provides Python bindings that are designed to feel like Tcl.
2. `sees <https://pypi.org/project/sees>`_ is a Python package developed by Claudio Perez and colleagues at UC Berkeley which exposes the new OpenSeesRT interpreter architecture to provide both a Tcl interpreter and Python module simultaneously.

Both packages are actively developed through the central `OpenSees GitHub repository <https://github.com/OpenSees/OpenSees>`_.

Once `Python <https://python.org>`_ is installed, both packages can be installed using ``pip`` on Windows, Mac, or a Linux operating system.
