OpenSees Documentation
======================

The Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) is a software framework for simulating the dynamic response of structural and geotechnical systems. OpenSees was originally developed as the computational platform for research in performance-based earthquake engineering at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. It is now widely used as a finite element application to study response of structures across all natural hazards including Fire, Wind, Earthquake, and Wave action due to Tsunami or Storm Surge.

As part of the code development efforts, a number of applications built using the framework are made available. The usage of these applications is presented in the following chapters.
