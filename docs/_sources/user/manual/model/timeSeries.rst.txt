Time Series Command
*******************

This command is used to construct a TimeSeries object which represents the relationship between the time in the domain, :math:`t`, and the load factor applied to the loads, :math:`\lambda`, in the load pattern with which the TimeSeries object is associated, i.e. :math:`\lambda = F(t)`.

   $type, |string|,      type of time series
   $tag,  |integer|,     unique time series tag.
   $args, |list|,        a list of arguments with args depending on type


The following subsections contain information about **$type** and the number of nodes and args required for each of the available element types:
