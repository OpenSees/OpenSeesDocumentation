MP_Constraint Commands
**********************

Multi point constraints (MP_Constraints) are constraints that allow the user to define the relationship between the response of a set of the degrees-of-freedom at one node (the constrained node) in relation to the response of the degrees-of-freedom at another node (the retained node). In structural analysis MP_Constraints are used to enforce rigid-diapgragm constraints or equal constraints (response of degrees-of-freedom at two nodes move the same)
